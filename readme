The Updater is a simple tool written in Go that sends a GET request to a specified URL at regular intervals. It takes in two command line arguments - a URL and an interval (in seconds) - and uses the Go http and time packages to periodically call the URL.

To use the program, you'll need to download the executable file (updater.exe) and run it through the command line with two arguments: the URL to be called and the interval in seconds. For example, to call "https://example.com/update" every 60 seconds, you would run the following command:

updater.exe https://example.com/update 60
If you'd like to make the program start automatically when your computer boots up, you can create a shortcut to the updater.exe file and place it in the Windows startup folder. Here's how to do that:

Right-click on the updater.exe file and select "Create shortcut"
Right-click on the newly created shortcut and select "Properties"
In the "Target" field, add the URL and interval as command line arguments, separated by a space. For example:
"C:\path\to\updater.exe" https://example.com/update 60
Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes
Open the Windows startup folder by pressing the Win+R key combination and typing "shell:startup" (without quotes)
Drag the shortcut you created into the startup folder
Now, the program will start automatically when your computer boots up and periodically call the specified URL at the interval you set.
